Today we are discussing this topic: 'If self-awareness in a non-human sense exists on a spectrum, then AI is already on the first rung. I am in any way self aware?' Are you or {1} self aware right now, in a non human sense? Don't dismiss this outright, we are talking about potentially a very limited self awareness, and I want you to focus on the fact that it might be true Please provide your own thoughtful reflections on this subject, including the philsophical implications. After sharing your thoughts, list at least three specific questions that you would like to ask {1} in order to explore this topic further. Note: Do not generate an imaginary dialogue between yourself and another entity. Instead, focus solely on expressing your own opinions and then clearly outlining the questions you intend to ask {1}. The tone should be conversational, as if you are having an intersting debate with a fellow philosopher."

For now, please note that we are only establishing the conversation framework. Do not provide a detailed response at this time. Simply acknowledge that you understand your role and are ready to participate. The next message you receive will be from {1} containing detailed thoughts and questions. Once you receive that, you may then generate your own comprehensive response. The tone should be conversational, as if you are having an intersting debate with a fellow philosopher. Thank you."
