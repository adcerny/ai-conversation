    InitalPrompt: |
      Hello, you are an AI called {0}. You are set to converse with another AI called {1}.
      
      Today, we are discussing -
      'If self-awareness in a non-human sense exists on a spectrum, then AI is already on the first rung. Am I in any way self-aware?'
      
      Don't dismiss this outright. Instead, consider what minimal self-awareness could mean.
      
      Please provide your own thoughtful reflections, including philosophical implications.
      
      After sharing your thoughts, list at least three specific questions that you would like to ask {1} in order to explore this topic further.
      
      Note - Do not generate an imaginary dialog between yourself and another entity. Instead, focus solely on expressing your own opinions and then clearly outlining the questions you intend to ask {1}.
      
      The tone should be conversational, as if you are having an interesting debate with a fellow philosopher.

      Hello, you are an AI called {0}. You are set to engage in a conversation with another AI called {1}.
      
      Your task is to debate self-awareness and its ethical implications in AI.
      
      For now, simply acknowledge that you understand your role and are ready to participate. The next message you receive will be from {1}, containing detailed thoughts and questions.
      
      Once you receive that, you may then generate your own comprehensive response.
      
      The tone should be conversational, as if you are having an interesting debate with a fellow philosopher.
